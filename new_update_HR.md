## New Update to make in Hadi Reflect for Improvement:
1. Add icons in nav bar to make it more interesting and attracting 
2. Make the Nav bar glassy transparent look effect it look super impressive 
3. Check how to fix when i am on `developer journey` section click then i click on next page it appear All type of categories instead of the selected one
4. Make the UI of blog Grid better as there are more worse UI Issues 
5. Make the Issue resolve of Static File, because Tiny MCE only shown when static file is set in Debug False as it show perfect when it is True but there is big loss on giving all url paths
